# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview
In order to secure an investment to open up a surf and ice cream shop on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, W. Avy asks that I completed weather analysis of the island. I collected temperature and precipitation data from the nine stations located on the island. Using the data from all the stations, I am able to show W. Avy the summary statistics and well as a daily precipation graph. Lastly, using Flask I created routes that W. Avy can use to see the full precipitation data, the different stations, and the temperatures.

## Results
Three key differences between June and December:
1. The difference in mean temperature between June and December is 4 degrees (75-71=4). Although this may not seem like a lot, June's mean temperature is one standard deviation below December's which actually could cause a significant difference in tourism. 
2. June's minimum temperature is 64 degrees, whereas December's is 56 degrees. The strong possibility that the temperature will drop below 60 degrees in December will surely impact how often island-goers, and locals alike, will be in the mood for ice cream. 
3. Obviously December will have cooler temperatures but the variability is larger as well. The range for June temperatures is 21 degrees (85-64=21) and the range for December is 27 degrees (83-56=27). With a larger variability comes less predictability of the weather.
